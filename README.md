## 📖 About 📖

### **Stardew Fishing adds a fun fishing minigame directly inspired by Stardew Valley!**

- Bored of right-clicking and instantly catching whatever fish is on your hook? This mod is for you!
- The fishing minigame involves clicking to bump a small green 'bobber' bar upwards. 
- Keep the bobber bar on the fish to fill the progress bar on the side. 
- Fill it all the way to catch the fish! 
- Take a look at this visual guide below:

- This mod works with Aquaculture Fishing Rods, and has a customisable datapack to determine how difficult any given fish is to catch!
- The mod also contains Quality Food integration, where the Quality of the fish you catch is determined by your bobber accuracy in the minigame, just like in Stardew!
 

This mod was developed by the wonderful [bonker](https://modrinth.com/user/bonker)!

 

## ❓ FAQ❓

**Q: How can I change how hard it is to catch specific fish?**

A: With a simple datapack! You can change the default behaviour of all fish, and set behaviour for specific fish to make some rarer fishes harder to catch. You can change this with several values including their top speed, acceleration, average move distance and more. Examples datapacks and explanations can be found >[HERE](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stardew-fishing/download/5548093)<!. 

**Q: Do I have to have Aquaculture or Quality Food installed for this mod to work?**

A: Nope! Aquaculture integration is (so far) only to add support for the Rods and difficulties for specific Fish, and is entirely optional. The Quality Food 'Quality' of an item is determined by an NBT data dependent on how accurate you are with the minigame, but without the mod installed this tag simply isn't added, so no problems with stacking or anything like that.

**Q: Can I make the minigame easier?**

A: You can change the datapacks so that all fish have a simpler movement behaviour. An example datapack for how to do this is shown above!

**Q: Will you be adding Treasure Chests / Bobbers / other stuff in the future?**

A: Maybe, depends how much money I can find in my couch cushions. This mod is open source, so if you want to make an addon for it, let me know because I'd love to see it! 

**Q: Is this mod compatible with Better Fishing Rods? How about other fishing mods? **

A: If the mod uses the vanilla fishing bobber (like Better Fishing Rods does) then yes! Can't guarantee for other mods that add other fishing rods. This mod does not work with 'Fishing Real'.

**Q: How can I report a bug/issue?**

A: Leave a comment and hopefully we can fix it!

**Q: Will this mod be updated to 1.xx / Fabric?**

A: Not unless you have the money to pay my developer for it, because I sure don't :)
